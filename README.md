# Women's football quiz 2024

I love women's football. In order to sharpen my C# skills I decided to build a quiz game.
The game displays a Tic Tac Toe board in the console. Each square has a number that represents a question.
If the player answers a question correctly you get 10 points. 
Answer all 9 questions and find out your score!

At the end you will have the option to save your score to the scoreboard or exit the game.
The scoreboard displays your name and score in percentages. 

Future features that can be added: 
- Right now the player's score is saved to the first slot on the scoreboard. If a player would want to play again the score would not be saved. I would want it to be saved.
- At the end I would want the player to have the option of playing again.
